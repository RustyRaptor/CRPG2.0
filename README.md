In order to compile it you'll need Visual Studio. 
Create a new Windows Console Project and attach to the Header Files folder the files preproc.h and prototype.h
Insert the file firstLevel.map into the folder Source Files.
To link the resources (the 2 wav files and the ico) Right Click on the Resource Files folder -> 
Add Resource... *it doesn't matter which type of resource you choose, as it will be automatically changed*
-> Import -> *select the All files filter to see the files* and pick the file you want.
Automatically, a header file called resource.h will be created and it will contain the links to your resources.
